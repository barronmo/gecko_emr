-change file locations for Meds.OnPrintMeds for the script.html file
-in Selectable change the folder locations to reflect Windows path for patient folders as well as several changes from / to \.

bugs:
-vitals dates in wrong format
-notes dates saved truncated; field may not be long enough
-when removing a problem get error msg saying 'couldn't retrieve information about list control item 6'
-medication lists are not showing up but are in the database; the reason is that the query looks for records where 'archive' = 0 but the records are most 'NULL' unless changed manually.  I used update query to change all to '0'.
-if you enter an allergy reason with an apostrophe you get an error because it messes up the SQL query which is enclosed in quotes in the code
-when saving a note if there are " anywhere I get a SQL error and it doesn't save
